### Database Files
- Files end with `.db` extension

- Example uses:
  - `jewelcalc.db` - Main database
  - `store1.db` - Branch 1
  - `store2.db` - Branch 2
  - `test.db` - Testing/training

### Creating New Database
- Simply enter a new filename ending with `.db` in the sidebar
- If the file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically
- All necessary tables are created on first use

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: Create backups before making major changes
2. **Export Data**: Periodically export customers and invoices for redundancy
3. **Test First**: Use a test database to familiarize yourself with features
4. **Thermal Printing**: Test thermal print format with your printer before production use
5. **Edit Carefully**: Always review invoice changes before saving
6. **Import Validation**: Check error messages when importing data

## Security Notes

- Keep database files secure - they contain sensitive customer data
- Backup files contain complete data - store them safely
- CSV/JSON exports contain customer information - handle with care
- Use file encryption for additional security if needed

## Troubleshooting

### PDF Issues
- If PDF doesn't download, check browser download settings
- For thermal print, ensure printer supports 80mm width
- Print PDF may be blocked by pop-up blockers

### Import Errors
- Check CSV/JSON format matches requirements
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Verify customer IDs exist before importing invoices
- Check for duplicate phone numbers or account numbers

### Database Issues
- If database is corrupted, restore from backup
- Ensure `.db` files are not opened by other programs
- Check file permissions if database won't open
